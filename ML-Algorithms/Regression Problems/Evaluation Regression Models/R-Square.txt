## R^2 ##

Remember in Simple Linear Regression(SLR) we had MSE.
MSE gives us the BEST LINE.
R^2 also considers how good the line is compared to the avg line of your dataset.


# R^2 = 1 - (SS_res - SS_tot)

 where,
   SS_res = SUM (y_i - y_pred)^2
   SS_tot = SUM (y_i - y_avg)^2

R^2 closer to 1 means the better. 


## Adjusted R^2 ##
When we add more and more features, (for example from SLE to MLR).
For example, we are experimenting with adding new varables each time
and see whether the model imporves or not. 

In adjusted R^2 formula we give penalty for adding uselss random variables.
